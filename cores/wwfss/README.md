# Start Buttons

The original arcade had three start buttons:

- 1P START, the player fights the CPU
- 2P START, player 1 fights player 2
- 1P/2P vs CPU, both players fight against the CPU

Because of how MiSTer and other platforms handles controls, these buttons are mapped in the following way:

- 1P START -> start button of first controller
- 2P START -> start button of second controller
- 1P/2P vs CPU -> third button of any controller
